# Java Fantasy Library
Simple Java exercise where I practised Java classes, objects, arrays and functions.

## Description
When running the program, user can add books to the library, remove them, change books read status or remove them completely.

The books are stored only on the memory, so when user runs the program again the saved changes disappear.
