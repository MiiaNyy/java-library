# Java Fantasy Library
Simple Java exercise where I practised Java classes, objects, arrays and functions.

## Description
When running the program, user can add books to the library, remove them, change books read status or remove them completely.

The program runs on the terminal and user gives different commands by writing them on the terminal.

The books are stored only on the memory, so when user runs the program again the saved changes disappear.
